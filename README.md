Initialization: The program initializes some variables, such as standard and premium seat prices, the number of available seats for each type, and a running total for the current booking.

Booking Loop: The program runs in a continuous loop (while True) to handle multiple bookings. It prompts the user to enter details for each booking, such as the movie name, seat type (standard or premium), and the number of seats.

Seat Availability Check: It checks if the requested number of seats is available for the chosen seat type. If seats are available, it calculates the total cost based on the seat type and quantity.

Combo Option: The user is given the option to add a combo to their booking, choosing between Combo A (Popcorn + Soda) and Combo B (Pizza + Drinks). The user specifies the quantity of the chosen combo.

Displaying Bill: The program displays a bill for the current booking, including the cost of seats and any selected combo.

Booking Another Person: The user is asked if there is another person booking. If the answer is "yes," the loop continues for the next booking. If the answer is "no," the program breaks out of the loop, and the program ends.

Input Validation: The program includes some input validation to handle potential errors, such as invalid seat choices, invalid combo choices, or non-numeric inputs.

Cinema Name: The cinema name ("Inox") is displayed at the beginning of each iteration of the loop.
